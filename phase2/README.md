#photo manager ~ phase2
This project uses Java and Javascript to create a photo manager application. It has many funtions including, adding, deleting,
and moving photos. You can also tag photos as well as create folders for storing. There is also a feature to list all photos
that exist below your current directoy. There is both a gui application or it can be used in the terminal as well. If you would
like to run it, you can do so by running Main in the src folder. There is also the design descriptions. There are some photos
already in there to demenstrate the functions, though they are a bit silly. I do not take full credit for this project, this 
was a group project and we all worked very hard to create this.
