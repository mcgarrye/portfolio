#towers of hanoi game
This project uses Python to create the Tower of Hanoi game in both gui and terminal forms. If you do not know, the Towers of 
Hanoi is a game mainly intended for children where you must stack disks on top of each other on rods, a clear explanation can
be found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). By running gui_controller.py, the gui will appear and the game
can be played by clicking on disks with nothing above them. You are limited in the way that you may not place larger disks on
smaller disks, which is displayed by flashing red. By running console_controller.py, you are able to play with a print out 
version in the terminal following the provided style of input. Both have 5 disks(cheeses) and 4 stools. Must be run with 
python3 to work. This project was completed with a teammate.
